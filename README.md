Here is where I am putting random things I am working. Feel free to comment, fork...etc 



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/seangrant82/seangrant82.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
